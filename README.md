The total number of trips that were made in the month was 2,344,224, where most of the users were already subscribed to the service where, in addition to this, it was found that the majority of people who use the bicycles are men

As we can see, the trips that are made are really short, it really is a matter of minutes, what should be highlighted is that most of the people who occupy this service are men and it is seen that the difference is really great compared to women

In the following two graphs, interesting and very coherent conclusions can be drawn based on what had been exposed before, first of all, the majority of times the bicycle service is used is between 7-9 in the morning and 5-7 at night, from what we might think, that the service is mostly occupied when people go to their work or home after work, in the second graph we can see that the majority of users who use the service within these hours are men, which reinforces the thought that this service is occupied to go to work

The last graph helps us to confirm what we had already exposed, since as we had said before, most of the users are subscribers, in addition to this, those who use the bicycles the most are men and this happens during the week to comply with the working hours
